# shearlet-scattering
Scattering transforms with shearlet-based filters. 

## Overview
This is a minor modification of the framenet codes of T. Wiatowski et al.  The shearlet-based filters did not run out-of-the-box for on my local machine.  Also made changes so that the parallel computing toolbox is not required.

I have also taken the liberty of downloading the software dependencies for framenet and adding them to this repository.  These include Shearlab 3D, MNIST data loading utilities, and a custom implemention of ols dimension reduction.  See the framenet documentation for more details.
